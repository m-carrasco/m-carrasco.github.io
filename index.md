## About Me 

I'm a PhD student supervised by Prof. Cristian Cadar at Imperial College London and a member of the Software Reliability Group. Nowadays, my primary research efforts are towards detecting portability and environment-related bugs. As a side project, I develop **net-ssa** which is an intermediate representation for .NET bytecode. Recently, I've started working on fuzzing-based testing techniques as well. Simply put, I'm a Program Analysis enthusiast.

## Research Interests 

- **Software Testing and Verification techniques** applied to real software.
- **Compilers topics** such as the construction of intermediate representations.
- **Research driven by applicability**: from theory to practice on real scenarios.
